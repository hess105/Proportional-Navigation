# Proportional-Pursuit Guidance System

The **Proportional-Pursuit** system simulates the motion of two bodies: one with a fixed velocity and heading (the **pursuer**) and the other with a fixed velocity but an adjustable heading (the **target**). This model demonstrates a fundamental proportional guidance algorithm, where the pursuer adjusts its heading based on the position of the target to attempt an intercept.

### Program Version 1

In this initial version, the focus is purely on the mathematical model. Real-world factors such as changing target velocities, air resistance, or limitations on the pursuerâ€™s acceleration are ignored. The goal is to understand the core algorithm, making it an ideal starting point for more complex simulations in the future.

## Example Outputs

Below are three distinct examples showcasing different scenarios for the proportional-pursuit system.

### Example 1: Positive Pursuer Velocity, Negative Target Velocity

#### Parameters:
- **N (Navigation Constant)** = 3
- **Pursuer Initial Position** = (0, 0) [m]
- **Target Initial Position** = (5000, 5000) [m]
- **Pursuer Initial Velocity** = (10, 50) [m/s]
- **Target Initial Velocity** = (-9, -50) [m/s]
- **Time Step** = 0.001 [s]
- **Max Steps** = 300,000
- **Intercept Threshold** = 0.1 [m]

#### Output:
- **Intercept** was successful, occurring at **187.73 seconds** (Step 187,727).

### Example 2: Positive Pursuer Velocity, Positive X Target Velocity

#### Parameters:
- **N (Navigation Constant)** = 3
- **Pursuer Initial Position** = (0, 0) [m]
- **Target Initial Position** = (0, 5000) [m]
- **Pursuer Initial Velocity** = (10, 50) [m/s]
- **Target Initial Velocity** = (50, 0) [m/s]
- **Time Step** = 0.001 [s]
- **Max Steps** = 3,000,000
- **Intercept Threshold** = 0.1 [m]

#### Output:
- **Intercept** was successful, occurring at **1170.86 seconds** (Step 1,170,857).
- A **collision triangle** becomes evident at approximately the x = 1000 mark, which signifies that an intercept is inevitable in this energy-conserving system.

### Example 3: Equal Velocities of Pursuer and Target (Edge Case)

#### Parameters:
- **N (Navigation Constant)** = 3
- **Pursuer Initial Position** = (0, 0) [m]
- **Target Initial Position** = (0, 5000) [m]
- **Pursuer Initial Velocity** = (10, 50) [m/s]
- **Target Initial Velocity** = (50, 10) [m/s]
- **Time Step** = 0.001 [s]
- **Max Steps** = 1,000,000
- **Intercept Threshold** = 0.1 [m]

#### Output:
- **Intercept** was not successful and will never occur.
- In this edge case, the velocities of both the pursuer and the target are equal. Due to the energy-conserving nature of the system, no additional energy can be added, and no intercept is possible.

## Summary

This proportional-pursuit system demonstrates the interaction between a pursuer and a target under varying initial conditions. The algorithm successfully simulates intercepts when the target is moving towards the pursuer and the relative velocities allow for a collision. In cases of equal velocities or other specific scenarios, the intercept may not occur, highlighting the limitations of this energy-conserving system.

The results provide valuable insight into how simple proportional navigation principles can be applied to track and intercept moving targets. Future versions of this program will address real-world considerations such as changing velocities, acceleration limitations, and external forces like air resistance.
